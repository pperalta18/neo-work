/**
 * Double-sided wall pieces (Phase 2 — 3D scene extensions)
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two of the expo walls are physically double-sided: the same divider carries
 * *distinct art on each face*. Wall **inv 2** ("Nave O") shows the S1 combustión
 * on one side and the S3 light-box hero on the other; wall **inv 12** ("Divisoria
 * IMAGE") shows the IMAGE-screen identity on its entrance face and the
 * confesionario / Turing-test on its reverse (spec §3D application). Until now a
 * placement could only hang on one face — you could drop two independent
 * placements on the same wall, but nothing tied them together, so they could
 * drift out of alignment and there was no notion that they were two faces of *one*
 * physical piece.
 *
 * This module is the *pure, serialisable* core of that look. It owns:
 *   • the face vocabulary (`Face` = ±1, `oppositeFace`),
 *   • which walls the brief designates as double-sided (`DOUBLE_SIDED_INV_IDS` /
 *     `wallSupportsDoubleSided`),
 *   • `planDoubleSided()` — turn one front placement + a back-face print into the
 *     two coherent, back-to-back placements (same wall / position / scale, mirrored
 *     `side`, distinct `printId`), linked by a shared `pairId`, and
 *   • the pairing queries + the edit helpers (`pairFor` / `facesOf` /
 *     `syncedFaceFields` / `unlinkPair`) the scene uses to keep the two faces in
 *     lock-step (move/scale both, remove both) and to split them apart.
 *
 * Like `tiling`/`zones`/`lightbox`, everything here is JSX-free and side-effect-free
 * at module load, so it unit-tests in the node `unit` project. `EventSpaceScene`
 * owns the three.js / HUD wiring; this owns the model and the invariants.
